I Will Give Thanks to the LORD â€¦8He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity. 9The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. 10Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You. https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/28/56/76285657c5177b81648227437dd17725.png https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BsZyz0GwL._AC_SL1000_.jpg https://dailyverses.net/images/en/niv/psalms-91-1-2.jpg https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics-imgs/en_GB/nasb/9-400.jpeg https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTdGUb4NNL9LLtgVM8XZ8Tn2unQSWx3p06Rmj4MVLCCj4olxB6b https://images.knowing-jesus.com/w/400/05-DEUTERONOMY/Deuteronomy+32-10+He+Found+Him+In+A+Desert+Land+red+.jpg https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChristian-Bookmarks-Scriptures-Survive-Storms%2Fdp%2FB07P5M86YG&amp;psig=AOvVaw2RURwIeMwNTZgeMECSB9s8&amp;ust=1582417887639000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCPi5z5H04-cCFQAAAAAdAAAAABA4
